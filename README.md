This repository contains all the necessary files needed for my python-challenge (module 3) submission.

*The majority of the code provided is my work based on class activities and previous challenges. I used stackoverflow to figure out how to turn zips and sets into lists as well as discovering the plus-equals operator (+=). Lastly, I had help from the class instructors in figuring out how to generate a txt file for my results.

*I've included comments within each python script that provides a general explanation of different lines of code.

PyBank
- The PyBank folder holds an 'Analysis' folder, a 'Resources' folder, and 'main.py'
- The Analysis folder holds an emptyfile (which can be ignored) but also contains a text file called 'results.txt' that contains the results from my python script within a generated text file format.
- The Resources folder contains the provided csv file (budget_data.csv) that was used to complete the assignment as well as an emptyfile that can be ignored.
- 'main.py' is my python script for PyBank. It returns PyBank results in both the integrated terminal as well as the 'Analysis' folder under 'results.txt'.
  
PyPoll
- The PyBank folder holds an 'Analysis' folder, a 'Resources' folder, and 'main.py'
- The Analysis folder holds an emptyfile (which can be ignored) but also contains a text file called 'results.txt' that contains the results from my python script within a generated text file format.
- The Resources folder contains the provided csv file (election_data.csv) that was used to complete the assignment as well as an emptyfile that can be ignored.
- 'main.py' is my python script for PyPoll. It returns PyPoll results in both the integrated terminal as well as the 'Analysis' folder under 'results.txt'.

Images & .gitignore
